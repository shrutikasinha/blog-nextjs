Things to note : 

1. I have tried to use multiple next js features that includes slug, styles imported from page.module.css and routing using app routes. 
2. Basic flow of the app - There is utils folder containing api file which has 2 api calls inside. I import those accordingly inside the components in order to fetch and display the relevant data. 
3. First landing page isa set of cards, click on any card and you shall see the details of the selected card in a new page enabled through slug dynamic routing.
